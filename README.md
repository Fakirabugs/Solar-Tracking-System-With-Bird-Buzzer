Automatic Solar Tracker System with Bird Buzzer

Hardware Components :
The major components required for the circuit are : - 

Mini Solar Panel     -   1
LDR (Photoresistor) - 4
SG90 Micro Servo Motor - 2
Arduino UNO - 2
Resistor (330 ohm) - 4
Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - 1
Buzzer - 1

Also jumper and connecting wires. For mechanism : gears, rod, stand, solar panel, etc.

Working Principle :
Auto tracking control system consisting of Arduino, sensor, LDR, cells, servo motors, jumper cables, connecting cables, and mechanical construction for working prototype.
Panel detects the sunlight strength with the help of LDR sensors.
The sensors output is given to the Arduino which uses the given algorithm in the code and then processes equivalent output to rotate the motors and align the panel in the direction of sun.
Bird death tolls increase every year due to solar farms in deserts to counter these we have added an ultrasonic distance sensor and a buzzer. As soon as the bird comes 0.5m near the ultrasonic distance sensor which is mounted on the solar panels in the solar farms it will send an output to the piezo and will buzz. This will fly the bird away.
